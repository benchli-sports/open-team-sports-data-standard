# OTSD v0.1 Introduction

OTSD defines a portability-first model for team sports operational data.

The primary use case is **data portability**:
- Export a team's operational data from System A
- Import into System B with high fidelity, preserving identity mappings and history

OTSD is designed for amateur to semi-pro team operations, and supports multiple sports.
