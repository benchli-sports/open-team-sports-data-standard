# OTSD Governance Charter (v0.1)

## Purpose
Maintain an open, vendor-neutral standard for portable team sports operational data.

## Maintainers
- The repository maintainers are responsible for releases and decisions.
- Maintainers should aim for consensus; when not possible, a clear decision is recorded.

## Decision process
- Material changes should be captured as decision records in `governance/decision-records/`.
- Decision records should include context, options considered, decision, and consequences.

## Neutrality
OTSD is not controlled by any product, although products may implement it as references.
